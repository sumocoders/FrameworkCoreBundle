# Mail stijling

We use Foundation, so consult the [docs](https://get.foundation/emails/docs/global.html) to see
what your options are regarding components, helpers, ...

## Logo

We use a logo with fixed width (182px) that is set on the img-tag in the mail template. This is because some
mail clients can't handle the size of an image right. We also use `.gif` extension for the same reason.

You can change the width of an image, but than you have to update the width attribute on the img-tag too.
